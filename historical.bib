  note-2 =       "The article begins: ``The FORTRAN project was begun in
                 the summer of 1954. Its purpose was to reduce by a
                 large factor the task of preparing scientific problems
                 for IBM's next large computer, the 704. If it were
                 possible for the 704 to code problems for itself and
                 produce as good programs as human codes (but without
                 the errors), it was clear that large benefits could be
                 achieved. For it was known that about two-thirds of the
                 cost of solving most scientific and engineering
                 problems on large computers was that of problem
                 preparation. Furthermore, more than 90 percent of the
                 elapsed time for a problem was usually devoted to
                 planning, writing, and debugging the program. In many
                 cases the development of a general plan for solving a
                 problem was a small job in comparison to the task of
                 devising and coding machine procedures to carry out the
                 plan. The goal of the FORTRAN project was to enable the
                 programmer to specify a numerical procedure using a
                 concise language like that of mathematics and obtain
                 automatically from this specification an efficient 704
                 program to carry out the procedure. It was expected
                 that such a system would reduce the coding and
                 debugging task to less than one-fifth of the job it had
                 been.\par

                 Two and one-half years and 18 man years have elapsed
                 since the beginning of the project. The FORTRAN system
                 is now complete. It has two components: the FORTRAN
                 language, in which programs are written, and the
                 translator or executive routine for the 704 which
                 effects the translation of FORTRAN language programs
                 into 704 programs. Descriptions of the FORTRAN language
                 and the translator form the principal sections of this
                 paper.''",
  note-3 =       "The IBM 704 had 86 instructions, a 36-bit word,
                 signed-magnitude number representation, and a 15-bit
                 word-addressed memory space (32768 words, or 191K
                 6-bit characters). Floating-point was {\em standard}, not
                 optional. 4K-, 8K- and 32K-word systems were sold, but
                 memory was treated cyclically, so programs compiled for
                 one memory size could not run on a system with a
                 different memory capacity. The machine was announced in
                 1954, and delivered in late 1955. From 1955 to 1960,
                 123 machines were delivered. [From Gerrit A. Blaauw and
