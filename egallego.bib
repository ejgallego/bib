  title={Constraint logic programming with a relational machine},
  journal={Formal Aspects of Computing},
  year={2016},

  abstract={We present a declarative framework for the compilation of
            constraint logic programs into variable-free
            relational theories which are then executed by
            rewriting. This translation provides an algebraic
                  formulation of the abstract syntax of logic
                  programs. Logic variables, unification, and renaming
                  apart are completely elided in favor of manipulation
                  of variable-free relation expressions. In this
                  setting, term rewriting not only provides an
                  operational semantics for logic programs, but also a
                  simple framework for reasoning about program
                  execution. We prove the translation sound, and the
                  rewriting system complete with respect to
                  traditional SLD semantics.},

                  of first-order unification problems and their abstract
                  syntax in a variable-free relational formalism which is an
                  executable variant of the Tarski-Givant relation algebra and
                  of Freyd's allegories restricted to the fragment necessary
                  to compile and run logic programs. We develop a decision
                  procedure for validity of relational terms, which
                  corresponds to solving the original unification problem. The
                  decision procedure is carried out by a conditional
                  relational-term rewriting system. There are advantages over
                  classical unification approaches. First, cumbersome and
                  underspecified meta-logical procedures (name clashes,
                  substitution, etc.)  and their properties (invariance under
                  substitution of ground terms, equality's congruence with
                  respect to term forming, etc.) are captured algebraically
                  within the framework. Second, other unification problems can
                  be accommodated, for example, existential quantification in
                  the logic can be interpreted as a new operation whose effect
                  is to formalize the costly and error prone handling of fresh
                  names (renaming apart).},

                  that can be instantiated to the foremost (and more)
                  reduction strategies of the pure lambda calculus. We
                  implement the template in Haskell as a parametric monadic
                  reducer whose fixed points are reduction strategies. The
                  resulting code is clean and abstracts away from the
                  machinery required to guarantee semantics preservation for
                  all strategies in lazy Haskell. By interpreting some
                  parameters as boolean switches we obtain a reduction
                  strategy lattice or beta cube which captures the strategy
                  space neatly and systematically. We define a hybridisation
                  function that generates hybrid strategies by composing a
                  base and a subsidiary strategy from the cube. We prove an
                  absorption theorem which states that subsidiaries are
                  left-identities of their hybrids. More properties from the
