                  machine for a higher order functional logic language
                  by extension of an appropriate architecture for
                  purely functional languages. To execute logic
                  programs the machine must be capable of unification
                  and backtracking. We show the integration of these
                  mechanisms in a programmed (functional) graph
                  reduction machine. The resulting abstract machine
                  has been realized in C code as part of the
                  implementation of the functional logic language
                  BABEL. A brief introduction to this language is
                  included. Moreover, we show a comparison between
                  BABEL and PROLOG based on the runtimes of some
                  example programs.}

 abstract = {The paper presents new techniques for the transformation of lazy narrowing in logic programs. A formalism, called demand patterns, is introduced, and used to define a demand driven strategy to compute lazy narrowing. The strategy is used to produce standard PROLOG code from programs written in a functional-logic language. Our method has a number of advantages over other approaches. While it can compute a larger class of program, it needs less reevaluation effort, and fully uses efficient elements of PROLOG compilers. The gain of efficiency is shown by presenting the execution times of some example programs.}

By extending an appropriate architecture for purely functional languages an abstract graph narrowing machine for a functional logic language is constructed. The machine is capable of performing unification and backtracking. The techniques used in functional languages to cope with lazy evaluation are not directly applicable, but must be modified due to the logic component of the implemented language. A prototype implementation of the new machine has been developed.}
