  abstract =     {The Fraenkel-Mostowski permutation model of set
                  theory with atoms (\emph{FM-sets}) can serve as the
                  semantic basis of meta-logics for specifying and
                  reasoning about formal systems involving name
                  binding, $\alpha$-conversion, capture avoiding
                  substitution, and so on.  We show that in FM-set
                  theory one can express statements quantifying over
                  `fresh' names and we use this to give a novel
                  set-theoretic interpretation of name abstraction.
                  Inductively defined FM-sets involving this
                  name-abstraction set former (together with cartesian
                  product and disjoint union) can correctly encode
                  object-level syntax modulo $\alpha$-conversion.  In
                  this way, the standard theory of algebraic data
                  types can be extended to encompass signatures
                  involving binding operators.  In particular, there
                  is an associated notion of structural recursion for
                  defining syntax-manipulating functions (such as
                  capture avoiding substitution, set of free
                  variables, etc) and a notion of proof by structural
                  induction, both of which remain pleasingly close to
                  informal practice.}
