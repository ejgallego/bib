Security, availability and efficiency issues of the proposed solution are described. A prototype implementation of a web interface for the Coq proof assistant [Coq Development Team, “The Coq Proof Assistant Reference Manual Version 8.0,” INRIA-Rocquencourt (2005), URL: http://coq.inria.fr/doc-eng.html] created according to our architecture is presented.
